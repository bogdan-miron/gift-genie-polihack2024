# GiftGenie

GiftGenie is a modern, responsive web application built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The app provides personalized gift suggestions based on user responses to a series of questions, generated by Gemini API calls.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be fully responsive on all devices.
- **Integration with Gemini API**: Questions are generated using Gemini API calls.

## About the Project

This web app was developed in 48 hours during the Polihack 2024 contest at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. The team created this project to combine creativity with practical utility to offer users a tailored gift selection experience. The project took second place for the webdev category.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
